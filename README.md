X-Line is a web based game software which main objective is to allign three or more cells of the same player.

This software is intended to provide a general and scalable solution to a Tic Tac Toe style of game.
The whole project is developed using 'html' as information storage technology, 'css' for applying style and visual enhnacement code, and 'javascript' in order to provide user interaction support.
